<h1>Let's play AdventureCraft</h1>
<h2>adventurecraft is a modpack with the goal of enhancing the gameplay, it adds features from already existing mods we would consider neat</h2>
<h2>the pack adds more goals but also more hurdles, it adds a better incentive for the end to get amethyst, and maintaining your thirst and body temp is a challenge, but not impossible</h2>
<h2>its also a challenge because health is split evenly, and if either your head or torso loses health, you instantly die, and maybe your farming kinda guy, or you wish to see variation in bees, well farming is enhanced and bees are smaller and have more variation</h2>
